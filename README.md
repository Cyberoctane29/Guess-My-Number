# Guess-My-Number
Guess My Number" is an engaging mini-project centered around a game where the player attempts to guess a randomly chosen number within a specified range. The project focuses on leveraging DOM manipulation techniques to create an interactive and intuitive user experience.

The game initiates by generating a random number within a predefined range. Through a well-designed user interface, players are encouraged to input their guessed numbers via interactive elements, such as input fields or buttons. The game dynamically updates the interface to provide feedback on the correctness of the guessed number compared to the randomly chosen one.

DOM manipulation plays a pivotal role in this project, as the interface dynamically reflects the game state. It handles user inputs, updates the displayed information, and triggers events to indicate game outcomes, such as correct or incorrect guesses. Through DOM manipulation, the project ensures a seamless and responsive user interaction, providing real-time feedback to enhance the gaming experience.

By combining JavaScript logic with DOM manipulation techniques, "Guess My Number" offers an immersive game environment that challenges players to employ their guessing skills while enjoying an interactive and visually appealing interface. This project serves as an excellent demonstration of how to integrate JavaScript functionalities with DOM manipulation to create an engaging and entertaining game.
